    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special 
        occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy 
        preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the 
        ideal variety to use.</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
      <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>Â½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
      <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until 
        lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain;
         set aside.</li>
      <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh 
        ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, 
        chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 
        30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.</li>
      <li>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</li>
