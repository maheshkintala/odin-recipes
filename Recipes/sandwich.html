    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe calls for plain white sandwich bread. You could also use sourdough, 
        brioche, or even ciabatta. You can really make grilled cheese with any type of bread 
        you like, but you should make sure the loaf is sturdy enough to handle the heat. 
        Thinly sliced, delicate breads will quickly fall apart.</p>
